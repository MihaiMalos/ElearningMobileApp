# Generators in Python

Generators are a simple way of creating iterators. All the work we mentioned above are automatically handled by generators in Python. Simply speaking, a generator is a function that returns an object (iterator) which we can iterate over (one value at a time).

def my_gen():
    n = 1
    print('This is printed first')
    yield n

    n += 1
    print('This is printed second')
    yield n

    n += 1
    print('This is printed at last')
    yield n

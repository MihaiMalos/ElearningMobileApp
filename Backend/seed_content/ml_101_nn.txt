# Neural Networks Introduction

Neural networks differ from other machine learning algorithms because they are derived from the way the human brain works.

They contain layers of interconnected nodes. Each node is a perceptron and is similar to multiple linear regression. The perceptron feeds the signal produced by a multiple linear regression into an activation function that may be nonlinear.
